# TODO List

## Architecture Decision Records (ADR)
- Research text-to-speech open source alternatives (fast, lightweight, low resource usage, voice quality secondary)

## Competitive Landscape
- Research competitive landscape for AI coding agents

## Agent Design
- Design agents so users can leave their work without feeling guilty — if your agents can't survive without you, they're not agents. Agents should enable genuine free time, not anxiety-driven monitoring. (ref: https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7430247119317528578)

## Notes
- Ensure numpad works properly (unlike Mistral's Vibe CLI)
